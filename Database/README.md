# LSTM Database Migrations

Run migrations whenever a branch adds or changes LSTM database schema objects.

```bash
./migrate_lstm_db.sh
```

Defaults:

- `LSTM_DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`
- `LSTM_DB_NAME=LSTM`
- `LSTM_DB_ADMIN_USER=$USER`, or `vjp` if `$USER` is unset

Override example:

```bash
LSTM_DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 LSTM_DB_NAME=LSTM LSTM_DB_ADMIN_USER=vjp ./migrate_lstm_db.sh
```

The migration user must have enough PostgreSQL privileges to create tables,
create indexes, and grant privileges to the runtime user `pqxx`.

The LSTM runtime user `pqxx` should not need schema-creation privileges after
migrations are applied. It only needs DML privileges on runtime tables such as
`inference_eval_result`.

Applied migrations are tracked in `schema_migrations`:

- `version text primary key`
- `filename text not null`
- `checksum text not null`
- `applied_at timestamptz not null default now()`
